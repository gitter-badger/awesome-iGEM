# The awesome manifesto

**What is awesome?**  
It's a curation of awesome stuff, not a collection. You can find in other awesome curations in [this awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#readme).


## Only awesome is awesome

Research if the stuff you're including is actually awesome. Only put stuff on the list that you or another contributor can personally recommend. You should rather leave stuff out than include too much.

## Comment on why something is awesome

Apart from suggesting a particular item on your list, you should also inform your readers *why* it's on the list and how they will benefit from it.


## Pay attention to grammar

Ensure your list is grammatically correct, typo-free and has no Markdown formatting errors. This should also apply to pull requests.

## Accept other people's opinion

Anyone should respect other people's opinion. If there are plenty of users not agreeing to your decision, give it a second thought.
